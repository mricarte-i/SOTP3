0. open 2 terminals (if using docker, make sure they are both in the same container)
1. make all
2. ./final_server on the first terminal
3. ./client_good on the second terminal (unless you have your own client you want to try out with)

NOTE: answers are the same ones as the original ./server, but we didn't try to hide them.
